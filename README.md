# Cambrian Explosion v0.3.2
> Jumpstart the evolution of your Wordpress sites!

## What is it?
A plugin to export the file and database contents of an existing wordpress installation, to be later imported into an [Evolution Wordpress](https://github.com/evolution/wordpress) site.

## What exactly does it do?
* Dumps the existing site tables as SQL
* Recursively copies the wp-content directory
* Packages it all into a zip archive
* Downloads archive to your browser

## And then what?
Generate a new site with Evolution, if you haven't already, and provide the downloaded archive to the included import script. It will do the rest!
